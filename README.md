# Sample_WR_Mod
This is a temporary sample mod to get people started in WR

1.) Make sure both options are checked in WR Launcher Mod Template

- Official WR Experience Mod
- Enable Workspace

2.) If inside of `Documents/Warsaw Revamped/Mod Toolkit/API Definitions` you do not have
- wr-core.d.luau
- wr-gen.d.luau
- wr-managers.d.luau
Run your server template once. It will download the required files.

2.) Copy `wr_official` from this repository into `Documents/Warsaw Revamped/Mods`

3.) In `Mods/wr_official/.vscode/settings.json`

Replace `YOUR_USER_HERE` with your windows username.

4.) Make sure Partitions is extracted. If not:

In `Documents/Warsaw Revamped/Package Cache`
Extract `partitions-0.1.zip`
Rename the extracted folder to `partitions`
