# Sample_WR_Mod
This is a temporary sample mod to get people started in WR Modding

Prerequisites:
- WR Launcher
- VSCode
- VSCode extension `Luau Language Server`, by JohnnyMoganz

--------------------------------------------------------

1.) Make a server template in WR Launcher and enable:

- Official WR Experience Mod
- Enable Workspace

2.) Run your server once to make sure above worked. You should see "Created script state for wr-official" near the top of the server log.

3.) Copy `wr_official` from this repository into `Documents/Warsaw Revamped/Mods`

4.) In `Mods/wr_official/.vscode/settings.json`, replace `YOUR_USER_HERE` with your windows username.

5.) In `Documents/Warsaw Revamped/Package Cache`, make sure you have an extracted partitions folder. 

If you do not have one: extract `partitions-0.1.zip` and rename the extracted folder to `partitions`
